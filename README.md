PropellerIMU
============

An IMU that uses Pololu MiniIMU9v2, and a Parallax Propeller

This software uses code by Michael Green, Jason Dorie, and modified by Seeker and myself.

As well, the algorithm used is based on the work of Sebastian Madgwick and Robert Mayhony's use of DCM filtering

Currently, the output is displayed on a serial display. 

Work in progress, debugging the output.
